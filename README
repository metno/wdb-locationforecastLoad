Compilation
===========

You may choose between two ways of parsing xml files when compiling
this program. Either, you may use libxml++, or you may use boost's
property tree library. The default is libxml++.

You may want to switch to boost when using ubuntu precise with amd64
architecture, since this has caused some memory problems. The switch
is done by providing the --with-xml-parser=boost switch to configure.
